This is a university project about data structures and algorithms.

In this project for the first semester of 2022, the goal is to introduce and practice algorithms using the Python Programming Language and then an introduction and practice of data structures in different programming languages.

The point of algorithms is that they power software. Just like in mathematics, algorithms are sort of a recipe to be followed in order to solve a variety of problems. One example of an algorithm that we can see in voth programming and math is, for example, how to calculate the factorial of an integer.

The point of data structures is to see the best way to solve a problem. Different problems, depending on the size and how fast we need them executed, will use different data structures that are more efficient.
